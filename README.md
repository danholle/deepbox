**Setting Up a Deep Learning Machine**

WARNING:  This is not quite ready to consume!  Published because I am testing the published version.

-------

This project captures some lessons learned from building up a Deep Learning machine on the cheap.  
Along the way, I stumbled into a few dark alleys;  I'm hoping that these files might help someone
by putting a light in those alleys  :)

I'm pretty sure nobody will walk exactly the same path that I did.  Thus the complete story is
not what's interesting here, although one of the individual pieces might be.  Sort of like "the whole is
less than the sum of its parts".  Therefore I have broken this up into a series of markdown
files describing particular obstacles I ran into, and how I got around them.

The idea here is to gather notes and scripts together in a form which is easy to find and consume.
If you're setting up a machine, you can "git clone https://github.com/danholle/deepbox.git" on that
machine and get all the (lightweight) documents and scripts so you can work with them locally.

Mini-articles you will find here:

 * [gpu](gpu.md):  Setting up GPU hardware and software for Deep Learning
 * more to come
