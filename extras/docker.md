## **Installing Docker**

*Docker lets you run applications (images) in a 
container... sort of a lightweight VM.*

-------

To view the Docker install script on your deep box 
(assuming you're still in the deepbox directory):

    cat extras/docker

To actually do the install,

    extras/docker

This script does the business and runs a test at the end
to let you know that Docker was installed successfully.
