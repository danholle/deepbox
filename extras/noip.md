## *Fast, Easy, Cheap:  Your New Deep Learning Machine, Without the Deep Learning Curve**

-------

*Are you a Deep Learning rocket scientist?  Great.  Are you a pro Linux hacker?  Terrific.  Are you an awesome computer wirehead who's nifty with a small calibre screwdriver?  Good on ya.*

*But if you're not all three of those... and neither am I... and you want a performant, simple, economical 
Deep Learning platform without a deep learning curve... you have come to the right place.*

I began with Deep Learning by experimenting on my i7 box.  I mean, it's pretty quick.  Mostly, if something's 
going slow on the i7 box, it's because I did something stupid.

Then came Deep Learning.

Holy cow!  Deep Learning would literally take a thousand of yesteryear's supercomputers, and hardly get started.  
More importantly, Deep Learning made my i7 box run for weeks at a time.  Hot and bothered.  Both of us.  

So I stumbled around a bit, coming up with a way forward:  a box that's 20+ times faster at Deep Learning than
the i7 at half the cost.  If you'd like to do something similar, read on.

Oh, and in keeping with the season... I come bearing scripts.  Wherever it was convenient to script stuff, I 
did so;  you will find the scripts here in this github repo.  

And there's a lot of TL;DR notes here in case you get stuck.  You may be a Deep Learning god, or a Linux god, or 
a Hardware god, but if you're not, some of these TL;DR notes won't be so TL;DR for you.

## **The Objectives**

 - **Performant.** Leverage technologies so performance is not a constraint.
 - **Economical.** But don't try to set world records.  The last mile is expensive and unnecessary.
 - **Functional.** This stuff is free:  Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, CNTK.  Get them all.
 - **Accessible.** Work from any machine in the world, as if you're local.


## **The Hardware**

To some extent, a good Deep Learning box is a GPU with legs (where the legs are the requisite
hardware and software to get at the GPU).  GPUs are that important.
