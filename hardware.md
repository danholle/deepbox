**Deep Hardware:  Buy?  Build?  Or in between?**

WARNING:  This is not quite ready to consume!  Published because I am testing the published version.

-------

You could
 *  Buy a box with lots of RAM and a big GPU 
 *  Build a box by getting a cabinet, memory, mother board, etc. separately
 *  Something else.

I tried something else, and it seems to have worked out pretty well.

TODO more needed
