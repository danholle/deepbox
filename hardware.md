**Deep Hardware:  Buy?  Build?  Or in between?**

WARNING:  This is not quite ready to consume!  Published because I am testing the published version.

-------

You could
 *  Buy a box with lots of RAM and a big GPU card pre-installed.  This might be
    a gamer machine.  The cabinet will probably look very Batman.
 *  Build a box by getting a cabinet, memory, mother board, graphics card, etc. separately,
    and assemble them.  Search for "deep learning machine" to find some of these.
 *  Something else.

I tried something else, and it seems to have worked out pretty well.

TODO more needed.  This section will contain 
stuff about xw6600, choice of graphics card, reseating memory, one GPU
